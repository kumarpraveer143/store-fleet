# Project Name: StoreFleet Backend System

# Project Description
The StoreFleet Backend System is a robust e-commerce backend application designed to support a full-featured online store. This backend system provides essential services for managing users, products, and orders, all built using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture for optimal organization and maintainability.

The project focuses on providing a secure, scalable, and efficient backend to handle core operations for an e-commerce platform. It includes features such as user authentication, product catalog management, order processing, and more. Built with flexibility in mind, StoreFleet can support integrations with frontend applications, third-party services (e.g., payment processors, email providers), and has a modular structure for adding additional features in the future.
